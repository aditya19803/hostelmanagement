# hostelmanagement

We are creating the hostel management system by using the singly linked list in c - language . We are taking all the functionalities of the hostel office as the functions in our program. For allocating the rooms for the students we are taking each node as the one room we are filling the details of the student in the nodes data and inserting another node for the new room allotment in the sequentially . By using traverse we can go to each node so we can go through each student details respective rooms 
insert(rollnumber, name, phone,roomno) :
this function use to inserting every node and node data to the head it is like  allocating next room to the new student
search(roomno) :
this function is used to searching the  student details by taking the room number as the key by traversing every node in the linked list
Delete(roomno) :
this function is used to vacate the already allocated room by erasing the details of previous student details and reading for new allotment here key is room number
update(roomno) :
this function is used to update or reallocate the already allocated room to the new student by overwriting the data in the nodes

this function is used to searching the  student details by taking the roll number as the key by traversing every node in the linked list
display() :
